# NLP-Text Summerization
# Project 
Text Summerization using NLP
<br>
# About
This project performs extractive summarization on a news dataset using NLP techniques.
<br>
It uses both the frequency method and weighted frequency method for extractive summarization.
<br>
The goal is to rank sentences based on word importance and generate meaningful summaries.
<br>
# Objective
This project focuses on extractive text summarization using word frequency-based methods. The objective is to generate meaningful summaries by selecting the most important sentences from the original text.
<br>
# Steps
<br>
Install Dependencies – Install required Python libraries.
<br>
Preprocess the Text – Tokenize text(word and sentance both), remove stopwords, and clean unwanted prefixes etc.
<br>
Apply Frequency Method – Count word occurrences, rank sentences, and select the top sentences.
<br>
Apply Weighted Frequency Method – Normalize word frequencies, compute sentence scores, and extract key sentences.
<br>
Generate Output & Evaluate – Compare summaries from both methods and analyze relevance.
