# NLP-Text Summerization
Project-Text Summerization using NLP
<br>
This project performs extractive summarization on a news dataset using NLP techniques.
It uses both the frequency method and weighted frequency method for extractive summarization.
The goal is to rank sentences based on word importance and generate meaningful summaries.
<br>
Objective=This project focuses on extractive text summarization using word frequency-based methods. The objective is to generate meaningful summaries by selecting the most important sentences from the original text.
<br>
# Steps-
<br>
Install Dependencies – Install required Python libraries.
Preprocess the Text – Tokenize text(word and sentance both), remove stopwords, and clean unwanted prefixes etc.
Apply Frequency Method – Count word occurrences, rank sentences, and select the top sentences.
Apply Weighted Frequency Method – Normalize word frequencies, compute sentence scores, and extract key sentences.
Generate Output & Evaluate – Compare summaries from both methods and analyze relevance.
